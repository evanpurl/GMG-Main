"Lore: The Allegiance-class battlecruiser was similar in appearance to both the Victory, Procursator and Imperial-class Star Destroyers, but was larger than all of them, reaching a length of 2,200 meters. Unlike the Victory and the Imperial, the Allegiance-class lacked ventral hangar bays. Like fellow hangarless models such as the Procursator and Tector-class, the model could seemingly only rely on its own exterior ordnance, as the Allegiance appeared to be unable to carry any starfighters or ground vehicles internally."
